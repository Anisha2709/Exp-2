# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:All UML models for the Library Management System designed and presented using StarUML.

# SRS (Procedure):
### Step 1: Problem Identification
Manual library operations such as issuing, returning, and tracking books are inefficient and error-prone. The objective is to automate these processes for improved accuracy and efficiency.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Identify user roles: Admin, Librarian, Student.

Specify core functions: add books, issue and return books, search books, manage members, generate reports.

Define non-functional requirements: reliability, data security, and an intuitive user interface.

### Step 3: System Design
Create UML diagrams including Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, and Package diagrams in StarUML.

Design database tables for Books, Members, Transactions, and Staff management.
